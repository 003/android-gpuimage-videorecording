# GPUImage for Android

Idea from: https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage

Goal is to have something as similar to GPUImage as possible. Vertex and fragment shaders are exactly the same. That way it makes it easier to port filters from GPUImage iOS to Android.

## Usage

### Library project
Add gpuimage as a library project.

### Copy paste only
Copy the the following files/folders to your projects libs folder.

* libs/armeabi
* bin/gpuimage.jar

## Create libs/armeabi
